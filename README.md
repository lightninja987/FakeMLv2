# FakeMLv2

This project is an improvement on the original FakeML project. While the original worked well for simply detecting fake news, it was impractical for 
personal use because it lacked both an interactive interface and a way to enter in only one article. To work out this problem, I used the tkinter module in python to create an interactive interface
and made the entire fake news dataset into training data and made a user generated string into the testing data.
